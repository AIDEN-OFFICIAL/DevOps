# üöÄ My DevOps Learning Journey

This repository is my personal hub for learning and practicing DevOps. It serves as a central place to store my notes, code snippets, and projects as I work my way through the DevOps landscape.

The content is organized into separate files and folders for each major topic, such as Linux commands, Docker, and Kubernetes. This README acts as my roadmap, outlining the plan and key deliverables for my learning journey.

## üó∫Ô∏è My 1-Month DevOps Roadmap

This is a high-level plan to guide my learning over the next four weeks, focusing on foundational knowledge and practical, hands-on skills.

### **Week 1 ‚Äì Foundations**

üîπ **Goal:** Get comfortable with the core concepts of DevOps.

* **Linux & Shell:** Learn file permissions, processes, and networking (`top`, `ps`, `netstat`, `systemctl`). Practice writing simple Bash scripts for automation.
* **Git & Workflows:** Master branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based). Learn about Git hooks and the basics of GitOps.
* **CI/CD:** Build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment of a simple Node.js application.

### **Week 2 ‚Äì Containers & Orchestration**

üîπ **Goal:** Dive into containerization and orchestration, which are central to modern DevOps.

* **Docker:** Build custom Docker images for a MERN stack application. Learn how to manage data with volumes, configure networking, and use Docker Compose.
* **Kubernetes:** Understand the fundamental concepts: Pods, Deployments, Services, and Ingress. Deploy my MERN application on a local cluster like Minikube or kind. Explore basic Helm charts.

### **Week 3 ‚Äì Cloud & IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**

üîπ **Goal:** Become proficient in a major cloud platform and learn to manage infrastructure with code.

* **Cloud Platform (AWS):** Learn essential AWS services including EC2 (virtual servers), S3 (storage), IAM (identity management), and CloudWatch (monitoring). Deploy the MERN app to a managed service like EKS (or ECS).
* **Terraform:** Write Terraform scripts to provision cloud resources (e.g., EC2 instances and S3 buckets). Learn about state files, variables, and modules.

### **Week 4 ‚Äì Monitoring, Security & Management**

üîπ **Goal:** Strengthen operational skills to manage and secure applications in production.

* **Monitoring & Logging:** Set up a monitoring stack like Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes. Get familiar with the basics of the ELK stack.
* **Security:** Understand IAM roles and policies. Learn to use secrets management in Kubernetes to secure sensitive data.
* **Management & Soft Skills:** Learn about Agile/Scrum project management. Get familiar with tools like Jira or Confluence. Study the basics of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and key metrics (SLI/SLO/SLA).

### **‚úÖ Deliverables by End of the Month**

Upon completion of this roadmap, I will have the following practical deliverables:

* A functional **CI/CD pipeline** for a MERN application.
* A MERN app successfully **containerized with Docker** and deployed on Kubernetes.
* A **cloud deployment** of the MERN app on AWS managed with Terraform.
* A basic **monitoring setup** using Grafana to visualize application metrics.
* All my **learnings, notes, and code** will be documented and organized within this repository.

# ðŸ§­ Step 1: Understand What Jira Is
 Jira is a project and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It helps teams plan, track, and manage work, especially in Agile environments (Scrum, Kanban, etc.).

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts
- Project â€“ A workspace for related tasks or features.
- Issue â€“ A single unit of work (task, bug, story, etc.).
- Issue Types â€“ Epic, Story, Task, Sub-task, Bug.
- Workflow â€“ The lifecycle of an issue (To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done).
- Board â€“ Visual representation of the workflow (Scrum board, Kanban board).
- Sprint â€“ A fixed period of work in Scrum methodology.

### Sprint->Epic->Story->tasks
- Sprint: a time-boxed period during which the team creates a set amount of work.
- f
- Epic: Big abstract view of work, then gets broken down into several smaller Tasks called Stories (complete website structure, et..)
- Story: "As a [persona(pesron who this user story applies to )], I want to [intend to achieve], [So that(bigger picture., overall benfit, problems to be solved)]" ex: As a regular costumer, I want to Easily login to my account, so that I can quickly acces my dashboard page.
- Tasks: actual tasks that have to be completed. ex:-Design JWT, Design user signup, implement validation when registering, etc..
- Backlog: a set of features required to develop a project.



**Agile:** incremental and iterative approach.
- an approach that divides the work into phases, emphasizing continuous
delivery and improvement
- stages: Plan, design, Develop, Test, Deploy, Review, then Repeat

### Principles of  Agile :
- Satisfy the customer
- Welcoming changing Requirements
- Deliver working software frequently
- Frequent Interaction with Stakeholders
- Motivated Individuals
- Face-to-Face Communication
- Measure by working software
- Maintain a constant pace
- Maintain technical excellence and good design
- Keep it simple
- Empower self-organizing teams
- Reflect and adjust continuously

**Scrum:** a framework of Agile.
Includes sprints, Epics, Stories, Tasks, sub-Tasks, etc..
Schedule the project completion. Plan the sprints and create sprint Backlogs.
Daily scrum meetings to track the Sprint progress.
There would be a last meeting called a sprint Retrospective that is like a feedback and Thanksgiving session for the previously completed sprints.

TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?INTRODUCE YOURSELF?

"sure, thank you for asking. I'm Aiden C.T., a recent BCA graduate and self-directed Full Stack Developer specialising in the MERN stack, which includes mongoDB, Express, Nodejs, React and JavaScript. I also have expertise in TypeScript and AWS deployment.

My strength lies in building and solving real-world problems with code while ensuring efficiency. For example, in a real-world project, I successfully reduced backend errors by 40% and improved scalability by 30% using robust error-handling, TypeScript, and Docker.

To further ensure solution reliability—which is critical in consulting—I’m currently focused on mastering DevOps and QA Automation tools like Docker,Playwright and Jenkins, proving my adaptability and continuous learning drive.

I'm focused on the Associate Consultant role at KPMG because I want to leverage my technical foundation to collaborate with your Advisory teams, transitioning from building individual projects to delivering strategic, reliable technical solutions for your enterprise clients. I believe my proven ability to thrive in demanding environments, like the highly challenging BrotoType program, positions me to contribute quickly and grow within KPMG."



FOLLOWUP:
WHAT IS BROTOTYPE?
"BrotoType is an intensive, quality-focused tech bootcamp I chose immediately after my BCA. I chose it precisely because it replicated the high-pressure environment found in demanding corporate settings.

It is structured as a self-learning platform where we are required to master an entire technology or concept—such as TypeScript, or a major MERN component—within a single week. The quality is checked through mandatory, rigorous technical interviews at the end of every week, conducted by senior developers working in the industry.I have been going through this process for the past 1.5 years, which has made me the best.


how did you reduce the backend errors and improved scalability?

----------------------------------
Why KPMG? what do you know about KPMG?

"I want to join KPMG because I’m looking for a firm where technology-enabled advisory isn't just a service, but a core strategy. Having researched KPMG India’s growth since 1993, I’m particularly impressed by your focus on Digital Transformation and the KPMG Ignition Centers. As someone who is currently mastering DevOps and SQA, seeing a Big Four firm prioritize cloud-native innovation and automation labs shows me that my skills can be applied in a meaningful, client-impacting way.


What truly resonates with me, though, are the values of 'Excellence' and 'Together.' In my journey as a developer, I’ve realized that delivering quality software isn't just about code; it’s about the Integrity of the system and a culture of collaboration. I’ve seen that KPMG is consistently recognized for its work-life balance and its commitment to continuous learning, which is vital for me because I’m looking for a place where I can grow long term.

Ultimately, I want to contribute my problem-solving mindset—strengthened through consistent practice to a team that values 'Courage' and innovation. I am eager to contribute to KPMG's mission of creating a positive impact 'For Better,' ensuring that the technical solutions we provide to enterprise clients are both secure and scalable."
----------------------------------
Why this role (DevOps / QA Automation)? 

"While my background is in Full-Stack development, I see DevOps and QA as the 'complex next level' of engineering. To me, building a feature is just the start; ensuring it is scalable and bug-free is where the real value is created for a client.

I have a very strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which gives me the technical stamina to adapt to new tools and complex workflows quickly. This transition aligns perfectly with KPMG’s values of Excellence and Courage. I’m comfortable with any challenge, and I’m ready to apply my problem-solving mindset to ensure we deliver high-quality, reliable solutions to enterprise clients."

----------------------------------
Why consulting? 

The Question: "Why Consulting?"
The Answer:

"I chose consulting because I realized that my true purpose isn't just to write code, but to use technology to solve real-world business problems. I wanted to move from 'building features' to 'providing solutions' for enterprise clients.

Situation: While developing my eCommerce platform, I noticed that small technical errors in the payment and refund logic were causing significant user frustration.

Task: I realized I needed to stop thinking like just a 'coder' and start thinking like a 'solution provider' to protect the business’s reputation.

Action: I used my mastery of DSA to re-engineer the backend logic for efficiency and implemented automated testing to ensure 100% reliability. I focused on the 'Excellence' of the system rather than just finishing the task.

Result: This shift reduced system errors by 40% and taught me that I find my greatest purpose when I’m making a tangible change for a client.

This is why I'm drawn to consulting.I want to use my technical adaptability to help enterprise clients navigate complex challenges and deliver work that truly matters."

----------------------------------

"Why should we select you over other candidates?"
The Answer:

"I believe you should select me because I bring a unique combination of technical grit and a consultant’s mindset. My resilience is best shown in my self-directed journey, transitioning from a developer to mastering the complexities of DevOps and QA, while simultaneously solving over 250+ leetcode questions , mastering DSA and investing 13 hours each day to sharpen my logical thinking. I don't just work hard; I work with a craving to constantly refine my skills and deliver Excellence.

I am also incredibly flexible. I am at a stage in my career where my primary focus is finding the right environment to grow and provide value. Because KPMG is my dream company, I am more interested in the opportunity to contribute to your enterprise clients and learn from your world-class mentors. I am fully prepared to be flexible on terms like salary and relocation  to prove my worth and build a long-term career here.

Ultimately, you’re getting someone who is highly adaptable, technically rigorous, and deeply committed to the KPMG pillar of 'For Better.' I’m ready to take on any challenge and push myself to the limit to ensure our team succeeds."
----------------------------------

6. What makes KPMG different from the rest of the Big Four?  

“While all the Big Four are prestigious, KPMG stands out to me for its strong people-first culture. My research showed that KPMG India has received multiple recognitions in 2025, including awards for workplace equality and mental well-being, which signals that the firm truly values its people, not just the profit. At the same time, KPMG’s recognition for AI-led digital transformation and SAP cloud excellence aligns perfectly with the high-impact DevOps and SQA environment where I want to grow in.”

But more than that, my choice is personal. I follow the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy. It’s a story of a commander who, upon reaching a remote island for battle, ordered his men to burn their own boats. It meant there was no retreat—the only way was forward, to fight and win.

I’ve 'burnt my boats' for KPMG. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve focused all my energy on mastering SQA automation and  transitioning into DevOps specifically to be an asset here. This single-minded focus and Courage mean that I am 100% committed to your clients and your team’s success. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

----------------------------------

7. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?  

"In five years, I see myself as a Technical Team Lead here at KPMG. I want to have grown from an Associate into a manager who handles high-stakes enterprise projects. My goal is to be a leader with 'zero haters'—someone so reliable, approachable, and technically strong that my team feels complete comfort in approaching me with any problem. I want to embody the 'Together' pillar by being the mentor that I am looking for today.


But beyond the office, I have a 'Glorious Purpose.' I come from a hometown where many children have lost their way and no longer believe that education leads to success. They look up to me because they’ve seen my deep commitment to learning and hard work to reach this firm.

In five years, I want my success at KPMG to be the proof they need. I want to use my position to show them what education and hard work can achieve.  I’m particularly inspired by KPMG’s '10by30' vision to empower 10 million youths, and I hope to lead initiatives like your Cyber Awareness programs in rural schools.  Ultimately, I don't just want a title; I want to be the change I’ve always dreamt of."

----------------------------------

8. What are your salary expectations?  


"Based on my research into the current market for developers with a strong MERN stack background and growing skills in DevOps and Quality Assurance, the standard value for this role is typically around 8 LPA.

While this is my desired expectation based on my skills and the technical rigor I bring, I want to be very clear that KPMG is my dream company. As I mentioned before, I have 'burnt my boats' to focus solely on a career here. Because of that, I am very flexible regarding the final numbers. I don't want salary to be an obstacle for my application because my main priority is to join the team, prove my dedication, and contribute to the excellence KPMG is known for."

----------------------------------

9. What other companies or roles are you interviewing for?  

"To be honest, I’m not interviewing with any other firms at the moment. My focus is entirely on KPMG. While I did attend a few interviews earlier and even received an offer letter, I chose to reject it because the role and the salary didn't align with my technical value or my career goals.

Since then, I’ve adopted the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy, I have put all my energy into preparing for this specific role. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve been mastering SQA Automation and DevOps specifically to be an asset here.

This single-minded focus reflects the KPMG value of 'Courage.' I don’t have a plan B because I am 100% committed to plan A. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

# 🟩 2. Personality & Self-Assessment Questions

10. What are your greatest strengths?  

"I would summarize my strengths into three main areas 

Resilience and Perseverance: I have a 'never-give-up' mindset. For example, I pushed myself to solve over 250 complex logic questions and DSA problems. This journey taught me to stay positive and keep fighting through technical roadblocks until I find the most efficient solution.

Fast Learning and Adaptability: I am a highly proactive self-learner. Even though my background is in development, I recognized the market need for quality and infrastructure, so I quickly mastered the fundamentals of DevOps and SQA. This flexibility allows me to adapt to any role or technology the client requires.

Hard Work with a Purpose: I don't just work hard; I work smart to deliver Excellence. Whether it’s refining a CI/CD pipeline or building a MERN application, my focus is always on the final product.

In short, I am a flexible, fast-Learning, and positive professional who is always looking for the next challenge to master."

----------------------------------

11. What is your biggest weakness?  

Task organisation: In the past, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by having too many tools—switching between Notion, notepads, and apps. This made me lose time choosing the way to work rather than actually working. To solve this, I’ve started strictly using Jira and Agile principles to centralise everything. By treating my personal tasks like a 'Sprint,' I can now prioritise what actually matters and stay on schedule.

Public Speaking: I used to get very nervous speaking to large groups. I’ve taken active steps to fix this by speaking in front of 200 students weekly at my training center (Brototype). I’m much more confident now, but still occasionally worry about saying the wrong thing( what if something comes out wrong), so I focus on over-preparing my technical points to stay grounded.

Setting Boundaries: I’m a very welcoming person, and I love helping others—which aligns with the KPMG value of 'Together'. However, I’ve realised that saying 'yes' to every request can sometimes put my own deadlines at risk. I’m now learning to check my Jira board first and provide a realistic timeline to friends or colleagues so that my own work maintains the level of 'Excellence' KPMG expects."

----------------------------------
12. What are three words your friends or colleagues would use to describe you?  

Reliable: I’m known as the person with 'zero haters' because I never hesitate to help. Whether it’s a friend in need or a teammate stuck on a bug, I’m the one who stays back to ensure the job gets done. People rely on me because they know my word is my bond.

Personable: I’m a naturally jolly and positive person. I love using humor to break the tension in high-pressure situations. I like people around me stay happy.

Tenacious: This goes back to my 'Burn the Boats' philosophy. My friends see me as someone who is 'always fighting' and constantly learning. They’ve watched me transition from developer to DevOps and SQA through sheer dedication, and they know that once I set a goal, I don’t stop until I achieve it."

----------------------------------

13. What are some of your most productive habits?  

I use Jira and Sprints to prioritize and track daily tasks.
Use a GitHub repository for storing notes daily, which allows me to track my progress and reference notes from any device, anywhere.
Daily practice on LeetCode and typing drills to keep technical skills sharp.
Using AI as a professional assistant to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
Committing 13 hours a day to professional development, 
I listen to industry podcasts to learn from MNC leaders.

These are the most productive habits which I recall.

----------------------------------

14. State the difference between hard work and smart work.  

Hard work gets the job done, but smart work ensures it’s done in the most efficient, scalable, and high-quality way possible for the client. I believe in working hard on the right things.

Hard Work is the foundation of grit and volume. It’s the 13 hours a day I spend studying and the consistency of solving 250+ problems to build technical stamina. It’s about doing the work that cannot be bypassed.

Smart Work is about efficiency and strategy. It’s using AI as an assistant to break down tasks, using Jira to prioritize my sprint, and mastering DevOps/SQA to automate manual processes.

----------------------------------

 15. What’s good about you? What’s not? What do you need to learn?  

“One of my strengths is my resilience and the positive energy I bring to a team. I’m approachable, stay calm under pressure, and I’m reliable. I’ve shown consistency by spending long hours learning and solving logic problems, which proves I have the discipline for this role.

What I am currently working on is my tendency to over-commit. Because I value the 'Together' pillar and hate to say no, this can sometimes put my own deadlines at risk.  I’ve also struggled with task organization in the past, but I’ve corrected this by following Agile sprints and using Jira to stay focused and on schedule.

What I want to learn next is how to take my development background into enterprise-level DevOps—especially infrastructure automation and reliability practices. I see this role as a chance to grow from a developer into someone who designs stable, scalable systems for clients.”
----------------------------------

16. What do you like to do outside of work or studies?  

“Outside of work and studies, I spend time helping others. I actively support my family by helping with deliveries and inventory runs for our home-baking business, which has taught me responsibility and consistency. I also enjoy helping friends and colleagues solve problems and guiding them in the right direction.

I’m passionate about giving back, and I’m currently planning on a low-cost, tech-enabled learning platform to help students learn skills with access to mentors, interview guidance, and placement assistance. It reflects my interest in combining technology with social impact.

In my personal time, I enjoy playing football and chess. Football helps me build teamwork and quick decision-making. I enjoy playing the midfield position because it requires both leadership and responsibility. Chess sharpens my strategic thinking. I also enjoy movies and games, which help me relax and stay creative.”

----------------------------------

17. How do you stay updated with new technologies and industry trends?  


“I stay updated through a mix of curated digital content and direct industry exposure. I follow tech news and intentionally use social media in a productive way by training my feed to focus on tech related content, which helps me stay current without wasting time.

I also regularly watch podcasts and talks by experienced professionals, CEOs, and engineering leaders to understand real-world trends and decision-making. Additionally, through Brototype, I attend industry interaction sessions where IT leaders and professionals share insights and answer questions directly. This combination helps me stay both technically updated and industry-aware.”

# 🟧 3. Behavioral / STAR-Method Questions

18. Describe a situation where you were given performance feedback. What did you do next?  

Situation: During my training, I receive weekly performance feedback from experienced industry professionals. In my third week of DSA, I struggled with a timed assessment that included a hash-map–based problem i dont remember which it was, and I couldn’t solve it because I was new to LeetCode style  DSA questions.

Task: The feedback highlighted that my fundamentals were good, but I needed more problem-solving exposure and speed under pressure. I had to close that gap quickly.

Action: So I took the feedback seriously and changed my approach. I started practising  LeetCode consistently, focusing on core DSA patterns from Blind 75. I analyzed my mistakes, revised concepts, and practised DSA problems to build confidence.

Result: When I faced the next assessment, I solved similar problems successfully and completed the week. More importantly, the experience taught me how to accept feedback, act on it quickly, and turn a failure into measurable improvement, which is how I continue to grow today.
----------------------------------

19. Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.  

while I was enrolled as a MERN stack student at Brototype.
Last month, I was under some financial pressure at home and needed to support my family. At the same time, I noticed strong market demand and openings for DevOps and SQA roles.

Task: So, I had to make a difficult decision—either continue without change or take a risk that could delay my progress but better align with my long-term career goals.

Action: After thinking for nearly a week, I decided to take a temporary three-month break from the program. During this time, I focused fully on learning DevOps and SQA fundamentals, understanding how they work at an enterprise level. I planned my time carefully to make the most of the break.

Result: Although it was a risky decision, it helped me build clarity and relevant skills aligned with my career. Today, I’m confident in my foundation and proud that I took a well-thought-out risk to grow, rather than staying in my comfort zone.

----------------------------------
20. Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult person.  

Situation: During my BCA group project, one teammate preferred working alone and didn’t communicate much, which made collaboration difficult.

Task: I needed to make sure the project stayed collaborative and that everyone, including me, could contribute effectively.

Action: I addressed the issue directly by sharing my concerns and asking for better coordination. This helped align responsibilities and improve communication.

Result: The team worked smoothly after that, completed the project successfully, and I learned that speaking up early is key to handling difficult working relationships.

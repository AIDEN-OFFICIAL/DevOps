TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?INTRODUCE YOURSELF?

"sure, thank you for asking. I'm Aiden C.T., a recent BCA graduate and self-directed Full Stack Developer specialising in the MERN stack, which includes mongoDB, Express, Nodejs, React and JavaScript. I also have expertise in TypeScript and AWS deployment.

My strength lies in building and solving real-world problems with code while ensuring efficiency. For example, in a real-world project, I successfully reduced backend errors by 40% and improved scalability by 30% using robust error-handling, TypeScript, and Docker.

To further ensure solution reliability—which is critical in consulting—I’m currently focused on mastering DevOps and QA Automation tools like Docker,Playwright and Jenkins, proving my adaptability and continuous learning drive.

I'm focused on the Associate Consultant role at KPMG because I want to leverage my technical foundation to collaborate with your Advisory teams, transitioning from building individual projects to delivering strategic, reliable technical solutions for your enterprise clients. I believe my proven ability to thrive in demanding environments, like the highly challenging BrotoType program, positions me to contribute quickly and grow within KPMG."



FOLLOWUP:
WHAT IS BROTOTYPE?
"BrotoType is an intensive, quality-focused tech bootcamp I chose immediately after my BCA. I chose it precisely because it replicated the high-pressure environment found in demanding corporate settings.

It is structured as a self-learning platform where we are required to master an entire technology or concept—such as TypeScript, or a major MERN component—within a single week. The quality is checked through mandatory, rigorous technical interviews at the end of every week, conducted by senior developers working in the industry.I have been going through this process for the past 1.5 years, which has made me the best.


how did you reduce the backend errors and improved scalability?

----------------------------------
Why KPMG? what do you know about KPMG?

"I want to join KPMG because I’m looking for a firm where technology-enabled advisory isn't just a service, but a core strategy. Having researched KPMG India’s growth since 1993, I’m particularly impressed by your focus on Digital Transformation and the KPMG Ignition Centers. As someone who is currently mastering DevOps and SQA, seeing a Big Four firm prioritize cloud-native innovation and automation labs shows me that my skills can be applied in a meaningful, client-impacting way.


What truly resonates with me, though, are the values of 'Excellence' and 'Together.' In my journey as a developer, I’ve realized that delivering quality software isn't just about code; it’s about the Integrity of the system and a culture of collaboration. I’ve seen that KPMG is consistently recognized for its work-life balance and its commitment to continuous learning, which is vital for me because I’m looking for a place where I can grow long term.

Ultimately, I want to contribute my problem-solving mindset—strengthened through consistent practice to a team that values 'Courage' and innovation. I am eager to contribute to KPMG's mission of creating a positive impact 'For Better,' ensuring that the technical solutions we provide to enterprise clients are both secure and scalable."
----------------------------------
Why this role (DevOps / QA Automation)? 

"While my background is in Full-Stack development, I see DevOps and QA as the 'complex next level' of engineering. To me, building a feature is just the start; ensuring it is scalable and bug-free is where the real value is created for a client.

I have a very strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which gives me the technical stamina to adapt to new tools and complex workflows quickly. This transition aligns perfectly with KPMG’s values of Excellence and Courage. I’m comfortable with any challenge, and I’m ready to apply my problem-solving mindset to ensure we deliver high-quality, reliable solutions to enterprise clients."

----------------------------------
Why consulting? 

The Question: "Why Consulting?"
The Answer:

"I chose consulting because I realized that my true purpose isn't just to write code, but to use technology to solve real-world business problems. I wanted to move from 'building features' to 'providing solutions' for enterprise clients.

Situation: While developing my eCommerce platform, I noticed that small technical errors in the payment and refund logic were causing significant user frustration.

Task: I realized I needed to stop thinking like just a 'coder' and start thinking like a 'solution provider' to protect the business’s reputation.

Action: I used my mastery of DSA to re-engineer the backend logic for efficiency and implemented automated testing to ensure 100% reliability. I focused on the 'Excellence' of the system rather than just finishing the task.

Result: This shift reduced system errors by 40% and taught me that I find my greatest purpose when I’m making a tangible change for a client.

This is why I'm drawn to consulting.I want to use my technical adaptability to help enterprise clients navigate complex challenges and deliver work that truly matters."

----------------------------------

"Why should we select you over other candidates?"
The Answer:

"I believe you should select me because I bring a unique combination of technical grit and a consultant’s mindset. My resilience is best shown in my self-directed journey, transitioning from a developer to mastering the complexities of DevOps and QA, while simultaneously solving over 250+ leetcode questions , mastering DSA and investing 13 hours each day to sharpen my logical thinking. I don't just work hard; I work with a craving to constantly refine my skills and deliver Excellence.

I am also incredibly flexible. I am at a stage in my career where my primary focus is finding the right environment to grow and provide value. Because KPMG is my dream company, I am more interested in the opportunity to contribute to your enterprise clients and learn from your world-class mentors. I am fully prepared to be flexible on terms like salary and relocation  to prove my worth and build a long-term career here.

Ultimately, you’re getting someone who is highly adaptable, technically rigorous, and deeply committed to the KPMG pillar of 'For Better.' I’m ready to take on any challenge and push myself to the limit to ensure our team succeeds."
----------------------------------

6. What makes KPMG different from the rest of the Big Four?  

“While all the Big Four are prestigious, KPMG stands out to me for its strong people-first culture. My research showed that KPMG India has received multiple recognitions in 2025, including awards for workplace equality and mental well-being, which signals that the firm truly values its people, not just the profit. At the same time, KPMG’s recognition for AI-led digital transformation and SAP cloud excellence aligns perfectly with the high-impact DevOps and SQA environment where I want to grow in.”

But more than that, my choice is personal. I follow the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy. It’s a story of a commander who, upon reaching a remote island for battle, ordered his men to burn their own boats. It meant there was no retreat—the only way was forward, to fight and win.

I’ve 'burnt my boats' for KPMG. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve focused all my energy on mastering SQA automation and  transitioning into DevOps specifically to be an asset here. This single-minded focus and Courage mean that I am 100% committed to your clients and your team’s success. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

----------------------------------

7. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?  

"In five years, I see myself as a Technical Team Lead here at KPMG. I want to have grown from an Associate into a manager who handles high-stakes enterprise projects. My goal is to be a leader with 'zero haters'—someone so reliable, approachable, and technically strong that my team feels complete comfort in approaching me with any problem. I want to embody the 'Together' pillar by being the mentor that I am looking for today.


But beyond the office, I have a 'Glorious Purpose.' I come from a hometown where many children have lost their way and no longer believe that education leads to success. They look up to me because they’ve seen my deep commitment to learning and hard work to reach this firm.

In five years, I want my success at KPMG to be the proof they need. I want to use my position to show them what education and hard work can achieve.  I’m particularly inspired by KPMG’s '10by30' vision to empower 10 million youths, and I hope to lead initiatives like your Cyber Awareness programs in rural schools.  Ultimately, I don't just want a title; I want to be the change I’ve always dreamt of."

----------------------------------

8. What are your salary expectations?  


"Based on my research into the current market for developers with a strong MERN stack background and growing skills in DevOps and Quality Assurance, the standard value for this role is typically around 8 LPA.

While this is my desired expectation based on my skills and the technical rigor I bring, I want to be very clear that KPMG is my dream company. As I mentioned before, I have 'burnt my boats' to focus solely on a career here. Because of that, I am very flexible regarding the final numbers. I don't want salary to be an obstacle for my application because my main priority is to join the team, prove my dedication, and contribute to the excellence KPMG is known for."

----------------------------------

9. What other companies or roles are you interviewing for?  

"To be honest, I’m not interviewing with any other firms at the moment. My focus is entirely on KPMG. While I did attend a few interviews earlier and even received an offer letter, I chose to reject it because the role and the salary didn't align with my technical value or my career goals.

Since then, I’ve adopted the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy, I have put all my energy into preparing for this specific role. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve been mastering SQA Automation and DevOps specifically to be an asset here.

This single-minded focus reflects the KPMG value of 'Courage.' I don’t have a plan B because I am 100% committed to plan A. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

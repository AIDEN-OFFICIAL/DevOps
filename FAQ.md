1.TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?INTRODUCE YOURSELF?

"sure, thank you for asking. I'm Aiden C.T., a recent BCA graduate and self-directed Full Stack Developer specialising in the MERN stack, which includes mongoDB, Express, Nodejs, React and JavaScript. I also have expertise in TypeScript and AWS deployment.

My strength lies in building and solving real-world problems with code while ensuring efficiency. For example, in a real-world project, I successfully reduced backend errors by 40% and improved scalability by 30% using robust error-handling, TypeScript, and Docker.

To further ensure solution reliability which is critical in consulting—I’m currently focused on mastering DevOps and QA Automation tools like Docker,Playwright and Jenkins, proving my adaptability and continuous learning drive.
 
I'm focused on the Associate Consultant role at KPMG because I want to leverage my technical foundation to collaborate with your Advisory teams, transitioning from building individual projects to delivering strategic, reliable technical solutions for your enterprise clients. I believe my proven ability to thrive in demanding environments, like the highly challenging BrotoType program, positions me to contribute quickly and grow within KPMG."



FOLLOWUP:
WHAT IS BROTOTYPE?
"BrotoType is an intensive, quality-focused tech bootcamp I chose immediately after my BCA. I chose it precisely because it replicated the high-pressure environment found in demanding corporate settings.

It is structured as a self-learning platform where we are required to master an entire technology or concept—such as TypeScript, or a major MERN component—within a single week. The quality is checked through mandatory, rigorous technical interviews at the end of every week, conducted by senior developers working in the industry.I have been going through this process for the past 1.5 years, which has made me the best.


how did you reduce the backend errors and improved scalability?

----------------------------------
2.Why KPMG? what do you know about KPMG?

"I want to join KPMG because I’m looking for a firm where technology-enabled advisory isn't just a service, but a core strategy. Having researched KPMG India’s growth since 1993, I’m particularly impressed by your focus on Digital Transformation and the KPMG Ignition Centers. As someone who is currently mastering DevOps and SQA, seeing a Big Four firm prioritize cloud-native innovation and automation labs shows me that my skills can be applied in a meaningful, client-impacting way.


What truly resonates with me, though, are the values of 'Excellence' and 'Together.' In my journey as a developer, I’ve realized that delivering quality software isn't just about code; it’s about the Integrity of the system and a culture of collaboration. I’ve seen that KPMG is consistently recognized for its work-life balance and its commitment to continuous learning, which is vital for me because I’m looking for a place where I can grow long term.

Ultimately, I want to contribute my problem-solving mindset—strengthened through consistent practice to a team that values 'Courage' and innovation. I am eager to contribute to KPMG's mission of creating a positive impact 'For Better,' ensuring that the technical solutions we provide to enterprise clients are both secure and scalable."
----------------------------------
Why this role (DevOps / QA Automation)? 

"While my background is in Full-Stack development, I see DevOps and QA as the 'complex next level' of engineering. To me, building a feature is just the start; ensuring it is scalable and bug-free is where the real value is created for a client.

I have a very strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which gives me the technical stamina to adapt to new tools and complex workflows quickly. This transition aligns perfectly with KPMG’s values of Excellence and Courage. I’m comfortable with any challenge, and I’m ready to apply my problem-solving mindset to ensure we deliver high-quality, reliable solutions to enterprise clients."

----------------------------------
Why consulting? 

The Question: "Why Consulting?"
The Answer:

"I chose consulting because I realized that my true purpose isn't just to write code, but to use technology to solve real-world business problems. I wanted to move from 'building features' to 'providing solutions' for enterprise clients.

Situation: While developing my eCommerce platform, I noticed that small technical errors in the payment and refund logic were causing significant user frustration.

Task: I realized I needed to stop thinking like just a 'coder' and start thinking like a 'solution provider' to protect the business’s reputation.

Action: I used my mastery of DSA to re-engineer the backend logic for efficiency and implemented automated testing to ensure 100% reliability. I focused on the 'Excellence' of the system rather than just finishing the task.

Result: This shift reduced system errors by 40% and taught me that I find my greatest purpose when I’m making a tangible change for a client.

This is why I'm drawn to consulting.I want to use my technical adaptability to help enterprise clients navigate complex challenges and deliver work that truly matters."

----------------------------------

"Why should we select you over other candidates?"
The Answer:

"I believe you should select me because I bring a unique combination of technical grit and a consultant’s mindset. My resilience is best shown in my self-directed journey, transitioning from a developer to mastering the complexities of DevOps and QA, while simultaneously solving over 250+ leetcode questions , mastering DSA and investing 13 hours each day to sharpen my logical thinking. I don't just work hard; I work with a craving to constantly refine my skills and deliver Excellence.

I am also incredibly flexible. I am at a stage in my career where my primary focus is finding the right environment to grow and provide value. Because KPMG is my dream company, I am more interested in the opportunity to contribute to your enterprise clients and learn from your world-class mentors. I am fully prepared to be flexible on terms like salary and relocation  to prove my worth and build a long-term career here.

Ultimately, you’re getting someone who is highly adaptable, technically rigorous, and deeply committed to the KPMG pillar of 'For Better.' I’m ready to take on any challenge and push myself to the limit to ensure our team succeeds."
----------------------------------

6. What makes KPMG different from the rest of the Big Four?  

“While all the Big Four are prestigious, KPMG stands out to me for its strong people-first culture. My research showed that KPMG India has received multiple recognitions in 2025, including awards for workplace equality and mental well-being, which signals that the firm truly values its people, not just the profit. At the same time, KPMG’s recognition for AI-led digital transformation and SAP cloud excellence aligns perfectly with the high-impact DevOps and SQA environment where I want to grow in.”

But more than that, my choice is personal. I follow the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy. It’s a story of a commander who, upon reaching a remote island for battle, ordered his men to burn their own boats. It meant there was no retreat—the only way was forward, to fight and win.

I’ve 'burnt my boats' for KPMG. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve focused all my energy on mastering SQA automation and  transitioning into DevOps specifically to be an asset here. This single-minded focus and Courage mean that I am 100% committed to your clients and your team’s success. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

----------------------------------

7. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?  

"In five years, I see myself as a Technical Team Lead here at KPMG. I want to have grown from an Associate into a manager who handles high-stakes enterprise projects. My goal is to be a leader with 'zero haters'—someone so reliable, approachable, and technically strong that my team feels complete comfort in approaching me with any problem. I want to embody the 'Together' pillar by being the mentor that I am looking for today.


But beyond the office, I have a 'Glorious Purpose.' I come from a hometown where many children have lost their way and no longer believe that education leads to success. They look up to me because they’ve seen my deep commitment to learning and hard work to reach this firm.

In five years, I want my success at KPMG to be the proof they need. I want to use my position to show them what education and hard work can achieve.  I’m particularly inspired by KPMG’s '10by30' vision to empower 10 million youths, and I hope to lead initiatives like your Cyber Awareness programs in rural schools.  Ultimately, I don't just want a title; I want to be the change I’ve always dreamt of."

----------------------------------

8. What are your salary expectations?  


"Based on my research into the current market for developers with a strong MERN stack background and growing skills in DevOps and Quality Assurance, the standard value for this role is typically around 8 LPA.

While this is my desired expectation based on my skills and the technical rigor I bring, I want to be very clear that KPMG is my dream company. As I mentioned before, I have 'burnt my boats' to focus solely on a career here. Because of that, I am very flexible regarding the final numbers. I don't want salary to be an obstacle for my application because my main priority is to join the team, prove my dedication, and contribute to the excellence KPMG is known for."

----------------------------------

9. What other companies or roles are you interviewing for?  

"To be honest, I’m not interviewing with any other firms at the moment. My focus is entirely on KPMG. While I did attend a few interviews earlier and even received an offer letter, I chose to reject it because the role and the salary didn't align with my technical value or my career goals.

Since then, I’ve adopted the 'Burn the Boats' philosophy, I have put all my energy into preparing for this specific role. I haven't spent my time researching other firms or building backup plans because I’ve been mastering SQA Automation and DevOps specifically to be an asset here.

This single-minded focus reflects the KPMG value of 'Courage.' I don’t have a plan B because I am 100% committed to plan A. I’m not just looking for a role; I’m looking to win for KPMG."

----------------------------------

# 🟩 2. Personality & Self-Assessment Questions

10. What are your greatest strengths?  

"I would summarize my strengths into three main areas 

Resilience and Perseverance: I have a 'never-give-up' mindset. For example, I pushed myself to solve over 250 complex logic questions and DSA problems. This journey taught me to stay positive and keep fighting through technical roadblocks until I find the most efficient solution.

Fast Learning and Adaptability: I am a highly proactive self-learner. Even though my background is in development, I recognized the market need for quality and infrastructure, so I quickly mastered the fundamentals of DevOps and SQA. This flexibility allows me to adapt to any role or technology the client requires.

Hard Work with a Purpose: I don't just work hard; I work smart to deliver Excellence. Whether it’s refining a CI/CD pipeline or building a MERN application, my focus is always on the final product.

In short, I am a flexible, fast-Learning, and positive professional who is always looking for the next challenge to master."

----------------------------------

11. What is your biggest weakness?  

Task organisation: In the past, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by having too many tools—switching between Notion, notepads, and apps. This made me lose time choosing the way to work rather than actually working. To solve this, I’ve started strictly using Jira and Agile principles to centralise everything. By treating my personal tasks like a 'Sprint,' I can now prioritise what actually matters and stay on schedule.

Public Speaking: I used to get very nervous speaking to large groups. I’ve taken active steps to fix this by speaking in front of 200 students weekly at my training center (Brototype). I’m much more confident now, but still occasionally worry about saying the wrong thing( what if something comes out wrong), so I focus on over-preparing my technical points to stay grounded.

Setting Boundaries: I’m a very welcoming person, and I love helping others—which aligns with the KPMG value of 'Together'. However, I’ve realised that saying 'yes' to every request can sometimes put my own deadlines at risk. I’m now learning to check my Jira board first and provide a realistic timeline to friends or colleagues so that my own work maintains the level of 'Excellence' KPMG expects."

----------------------------------
12. What are three words your friends or colleagues would use to describe you?  

Reliable: I’m known as the person with 'zero haters' because I never hesitate to help. Whether it’s a friend in need or a teammate stuck on a bug, I’m the one who stays back to ensure the job gets done. People rely on me because they know my word is my bond.

Personable: I’m a naturally jolly and positive person. I love using humor to break the tension in high-pressure situations. I like people around me stay happy.

Tenacious: This goes back to my 'Burn the Boats' philosophy. My friends see me as someone who is 'always fighting' and constantly learning. They’ve watched me transition from developer to DevOps and SQA through sheer dedication, and they know that once I set a goal, I don’t stop until I achieve it."

----------------------------------

13. What are some of your most productive habits?  

I use Jira and Sprints to prioritize and track daily tasks.
Use a GitHub repository for storing notes daily, which allows me to track my progress and reference notes from any device, anywhere.
Daily practice on LeetCode and typing drills to keep technical skills sharp.
Using AI as a professional assistant to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
Committing 13 hours a day to professional development, 
I listen to industry podcasts to learn from MNC leaders.

These are the most productive habits which I recall.

----------------------------------

14. State the difference between hard work and smart work.  

Hard work gets the job done, but smart work ensures it’s done in the most efficient, scalable, and high-quality way possible for the client. I believe I have to balance both.
Hard Work is the foundation of grit and volume. It’s the 13 hours a day I spend studying and the consistency of solving 250+ problems to build technical stamina. It’s about doing the work that cannot be bypassed.

Smart Work is about efficiency and strategy. It’s using AI as an assistant to break down tasks, using Jira to prioritize my sprint, and mastering DevOps/SQA to automate manual processes.

----------------------------------

 15. What’s good about you? What’s not? What do you need to learn?  

“One of my strengths is my resilience and the positive energy I bring to a team. I’m approachable, stay calm under pressure, and I’m reliable. I’ve shown consistency by spending long hours learning and solving logic problems, which proves I have the discipline for this role.

What I am currently working on is my tendency to over-commit. Because I value the 'Together' pillar and hate to say no, this can sometimes put my own deadlines at risk.  I’ve also struggled with task organization in the past, but I’ve corrected this by following Agile sprints and using Jira to stay focused and on schedule.

What I want to learn next is how to take my development background into enterprise-level DevOps—especially infrastructure automation and reliability practices. I see this role as a chance to grow from a developer into someone who designs stable, scalable systems for clients.”
----------------------------------

16. What do you like to do outside of work or studies?  

“Outside of work and studies, I spend time helping others. I actively support my family by helping with deliveries and inventory runs for our home-baking business, which has taught me responsibility and consistency. I also enjoy helping friends and colleagues solve problems and guiding them in the right direction.

I’m passionate about giving back, and I’m currently planning on a low-cost, tech-enabled learning platform to help students learn skills with access to mentors, interview guidance, and placement assistance. It reflects my interest in combining technology with social impact.

In my personal time, I enjoy playing football and chess. Football helps me build teamwork and quick decision-making. I enjoy playing the midfield position because it requires both leadership and responsibility. Chess sharpens my strategic thinking. I also enjoy movies and games, which help me relax and stay creative.”

----------------------------------

17. How do you stay updated with new technologies and industry trends?  


“I stay updated through a mix of curated digital content and direct industry exposure. I follow tech news and intentionally use social media in a productive way by training my feed to focus on tech related content, which helps me stay current without wasting time.

I also regularly watch podcasts and talks by experienced professionals, CEOs, and engineering leaders to understand real-world trends and decision-making. Additionally, through Brototype, I attend industry interaction sessions where IT leaders and professionals share insights and answer our questions directly. This combination helps me stay both technically updated and industry-aware.”

# 🟧 3. Behavioral / STAR-Method Questions

18. Describe a situation where you were given performance feedback. What did you do next?  

Situation: During my training, I receive weekly performance feedback from experienced industry professionals. In my third week of DSA, I struggled with a timed assessment that included a hash-map–based problem i dont remember which it was, and I couldn’t solve it because I was new to LeetCode style  DSA questions.

Task: The feedback highlighted that my fundamentals were good, but I needed more problem-solving exposure and speed under pressure. I had to close that gap quickly.

Action: So I took the feedback seriously and changed my approach. I started practising  LeetCode consistently, focusing on core DSA patterns from Blind 75. I analyzed my mistakes, revised concepts, and practised DSA problems to build confidence.

Result: When I faced the next assessment, I solved similar problems successfully and completed the week. More importantly, the experience taught me how to accept feedback, act on it quickly, and turn a failure into measurable improvement, which is how I continue to grow today.
----------------------------------

19. Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.  

while I was enrolled as a MERN stack student at Brototype.
Last month, I was under some financial pressure at home and needed to support my family. At the same time, I noticed strong market demand and openings for DevOps and SQA roles.

Task: So, I had to make a difficult decision—either continue without change or take a risk that could delay my progress but better align with my long-term career goals.

Action: After thinking for nearly a week, I decided to take a temporary three-month break from the program. During this time, I focused fully on learning DevOps and SQA fundamentals, understanding how they work at an enterprise level. I planned my time carefully to make the most of the break.

Result: Although it was a risky decision, it helped me build clarity and relevant skills aligned with my career. Today, I’m confident in my foundation and proud that I took a well-thought-out risk to grow, rather than staying in my comfort zone.

----------------------------------
20. Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult person.  

Situation: During my BCA group project, one teammate preferred working alone and didn’t communicate much, which made collaboration difficult.

Task: I needed to make sure the project stayed collaborative and that everyone, including me, could contribute effectively.

Action: I addressed the issue directly by sharing my concerns and asking for better coordination. This helped align responsibilities and improve communication.

Result: The team worked smoothly after that, completed the project successfully, and I learned that speaking up early is key to handling difficult working relationships.
----------------------------------

21. Tell me about a time you disagreed with a team member or a senior.  

The Answer: "During our ADHD Hackathon, we had a technical disagreement. A teammate wanted to build a complex SQL database structure, which would have been very time-consuming. I argued for Firebase (NoSQL) because our priority was real-time notifications and speed for the ADHD users.

Instead of just arguing, I quickly built a small prototype showing how fast Firebase could sync data across devices. Once the team saw the real-time performance, they agreed it was the better solution for our specific users. We reached a middle ground where we used SQL for user accounts but Firebase for the core app features. This taught me that disagreement is healthy if it's focused on the best solution for the project rather than personal ego."
----------------------------------

22. Tell me about a time you had to take ownership or lead a project.  

During The ADHD hackathon , we had a time frame of 4 hours to complete or find solutions for our selected problem statement. so i had to step in to divide my own team with different tasks for each of our team mates , for that i first tried to make an understanding about their skills , what are they good at  and at the end of the presentation we successfully delivered 3 solution for our problem statement , amoung which one is live and running. and 2 others are still in development.
----------------------------------
23. Describe your most successful teamwork experience.  
The Answer: "My most successful teamwork experience was that same ADHD Hackathon. We were a team of five with very different skills. While I focused on the logical architecture and backend, my teammates focused on the UI/UX and the research on ADHD triggers.

What made us successful was our constant communication. Every few hours, we checked in to see if the UI matched the Backend capabilities. When one teammate struggled with the API integration, I stepped in to help, and they helped me refine the user flow. Because we worked 'Together' and respected each other's expertise, we built an app that actually helped people. It was the first time I felt the power of a truly synchronized team."
----------------------------------

24. Tell me about a time you worked under significant pressure.  

"In the Brototype program, every week is a high-pressure sprint, but my most intense moment was during the JavaScript week. Since JS is the foundation of the MERN stack, I initially moved at a slow pace because I was being a perfectionist—trying to master every single detail from day one.

By mid-week, I realized I was behind schedule and wouldn't meet the deadline. I immediately pivoted to a 'Smart Work' strategy. I began using official documentation and targeted tutorials. I pushed my technical stamina to the limit, working long hours to catch up. By the end of the week, I had not only completed the tasks but also passed the review successfully. This experience taught me how to maintain Excellence under pressure by balancing deep learning with high-speed delivery."
----------------------------------

25. Tell me about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn?  

"During the ADHD Hackathon, I pushed a feature to the main branch without testing it first because I was rushing to meet the deadline. This broke the build right before our progress check.

I took full ownership and fixed the bug immediately, but that moment was a turning point for me. I realized that Excellence is about reliability, not just speed. This mistake is actually what sparked my passion for SQA and DevOps—I learned that 'hoping it works' is not a strategy. Now, I am obsessed with testing and automation to ensure that the code I deliver is always enterprise-ready."

----------------------------------
26. Describe a time you faced a major setback and how you handled it.  

"My major setback happened during my first full-stack project. I was so focused on the 'core' features and deployment on AWS but I neglected the smaller details like pagination and edge-case testing. I failed my first two reviews because of bugs in the payment flow and missing features.

It was a tough moment, but I handled it by systematically breaking down the feedback. I stayed back, manually tested every route, and refined my Nginx and hosting configurations. On my third attempt, I passed with a high score. This setback was actually a blessing; it taught me the importance of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and it is exactly why I am so dedicated to pursuing SQA and DevOps."

----------------------------------
27. Describe a time when you had limited resources but still delivered a result.  

"While building my Ecommerce portfolio project, I faced a significant resource constraint when my AWS free tier expired. As a student, I couldn't afford high monthly cloud costs, but I needed a live, high-performance site to show recruiters.

Instead of stopping, I researched alternative hosting solutions and chose Render. Because the free tier had limited RAM and CPU, I had to optimize my code—improving my MERN stack efficiency and minimizing middleware—to ensure the app stayed fast and responsive. By being resourceful and optimizing my existing code, I successfully hosted the project with zero budget while maintaining a professional user experience. This taught me that innovation is often born from necessity."

----------------------------------
28. Time when you felt bored or unmotivated  how did you make the job interesting?  

"During the sixth week of my program, I faced a highly repetitive study cycle for a rigorous MERN stack assessment. Having already covered the material once, I found it difficult to stay engaged with the same documentation and theory.

To regain my motivation, I decided to pivot from a learner to a mentor. I organized a peer-to-peer study group. I realized that 'learning by teaching' was the most effective way to master complex MERN stack concepts. By explaining these topics to my classmates and solving problems together, I discovered new edge cases I hadn't seen before. This not only made the process exciting again but also helped my entire group pass the review with high scores. It taught me that when personal motivation dips, contributing to a team's success is the best way to regain focus."

----------------------------------
29. Describe a time you had to gather requirements from a client or stakeholder.  

"While I haven't worked with a corporate client yet, I had to act as a Requirement Analyst during our ADHD Hackathon. To build a tool that actually worked, I didn't just start coding; I researched the specific pain points of people with ADHD.

I gathered 'requirements' by researching  what affects people with ADHD for Task initiation and understanding their biggest struggles, like 'time blindness', procrastination and 'task paralysis.' Based on this data, I defined the core features—like a simplified UI, a focus timer, an interactive companion and task organiser supported with AI. This taught me that the first step to Excellence is listening to the user’s needs before writing a single line of code."
----------------------------------
30. How would you handle a situation where a client is not satisfied with your work? 
"If a client is unsatisfied, I would first listen actively to their feedback without being defensive to understand exactly where the gap lies. Next, I would summarize their concerns to ensure we are aligned and take full ownership of any mistakes. Finally, I would present a clear action plan with a timeline to rectify the issue and ensure the final delivery meets KPMG’s standards of Excellence. This turns a negative experience into a chance to prove my commitment to the client's success.

This is how I would handle it, although I haven't had any direct clients yet."
----------------------------------
 
31. Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical person. 

"During a communication training session, I was tasked with explaining the architecture of a Full-Stack E-commerce application to a child. To make it relatable, I used the example of a Toy Store:

The Frontend: I explained that the Website is like the Store Window, where you see the toys and the price tags.

The Backend: I described the Server as the Store Manager who goes into the back room to see if a toy is in stock.

The Database: I explained the Database as the Giant Catalog where every toy’s name and location are written down.

I walked them through the difference between Sign-up (getting a membership card) and Login (showing that card to enter). By stripping away the jargon and focusing on the 'story' of a purchase, I was able to make the complex logic of a MERN application understandable to someone with zero technical background. It taught me that if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough yourself."

----------------------------------
32. Describe a time you went above and beyond to achieve a project goal.  
nil
----------------------------------
33. Talk about a time you managed multiple tasks to meet a strict deadline.  

"During the final week of my MERN stack project, I had to manage three critical tasks: configuring AWS deployment, fixing final bugs, and preparing my technical presentation.

Initially, I was overwhelmed because I was juggling information across Notion pages, physical notepads, and sticky notes. I realized my lack of a central system was slowing me down. I took a 'time-out' to consolidate everything into a single, prioritized checklist. I broke my day into three blocks: 'Hosting' in the morning, 'Debugging' in the afternoon, and Focus on the theory at night. By centralizing my tasks and following the pomodoro technique in a disciplined schedule, I met every deadline. This experience taught me the value of centralized task management and eventually led me to adopt the Agile and Scrum methodologies that I use today."

----------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------
# 🟥 4. Situational Consulting Questions (KPMG-Specific)

34. What would you do if you received conflicting requirements from a client?  

"If I received conflicting requirements, I would first document the contradictions and analyze how each one impacts the project’s timeline and budget. I would then schedule a brief meeting with the stakeholders to present these findings objectively.

My goal would be to help the client understand the trade-offs so they can make an informed decision on which requirement takes priority. I believe that proactive communication is the best way to ensure we deliver a solution that aligns with the client's ultimate business goals. This is how I would handle it, ensuring we maintain a standard of Excellence through transparency."

----------------------------------

35. How do you handle situations when deadlines keep changing?  

"I handle shifting deadlines by staying agile and organized. When a date moves, I immediately reassess my task list using the Eisenhower Matrix to separate 'must-haves' from 'nice-to-haves.'

I focus on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first to ensure the core requirements are met by the new deadline. I also maintain transparent communication with my lead to manage expectations. This approach allows me to remain calm and productive, ensuring that even when the schedule changes, the quality of the output does not."

-----------------------------------

36. How would you resolve a conflict within your team?  

"I resolve team conflicts by moving the conversation away from personal opinions and back to the project goals. I first listen to both sides to identify the root cause—whether it’s a technical disagreement or a communication gap.

I then suggest a neutral evaluation, such as a quick 'Proof of Concept' or checking the project requirements, to see which path adds the most value to the client. By keeping the focus on logic and team success, I ensure the conflict becomes a productive discussion rather than a roadblock. This is how I ensure we maintain a positive and professional environment."

----------------------------------

37. How do you prioritize tasks when everything seems urgent?  

"When everything seems urgent, I rely on Agile and Scrum methodologies to regain control. I start by breaking the workload into Sprints and shortening the sprint duration to create more frequent checkpoints.

I use Jira to visualize the tasks and prioritize them based on their impact on the final delivery. By focusing on the most critical tasks first—the 'Must-Haves'—I ensure that we meet our core objectives even under pressure. This systematic approach allows me to manage high-stress situations with clarity and ensures the team remains productive and aligned with the project goals."

----------------------------------
38. How would you deal with an unresponsive teammate or stakeholder?  

"I handle unresponsive stakeholders by shifting from passive emails to more direct communication channels. If an email goes unanswered, I’ll send a brief follow-up via a professional chat or a quick phone call to see if there is a 'blocker' I can help resolve.

I also find it helpful to send structured updates—instead of asking 'what should I do?', I'll say: 'I am proceeding with Option A by tomorrow unless you suggest otherwise.' This makes it easier for a busy person to give a quick 'yes' and keeps the project moving forward. My goal is always to keep the momentum without causing friction."

# 🟫 5. KPMG Culture & Values Questions


39. What does Integrity mean to you in a workplace situation?  

"To me, integrity means being a man of my word. It is the consistency between what I promise and what I deliver. In a workplace, this translates to:

Trustworthiness: Being the person my team can rely on to handle sensitive data and critical tasks without constant supervision.

Deep Commitment: Taking full ownership of my work, including admitting to mistakes immediately so they can be fixed.

Work Ethics: Choosing to do the right thing and maintaining high standards, even when no one is watching.

Ultimately, integrity is about transparency. It’s about ensuring that my teammates and clients never have to second-guess my results or my intentions."

----------------------------------

40. Tell me about a time you demonstrated Courage.  

"To me, courage isn't just about taking risks in code; it’s about making the right decision when the stakes are highest. My greatest act of courage was the decision to take a career break to support my family during a critical time.

It was a tough, emotional decision because I knew that stepping away  from my momentum meant I would eventually have to fight twice as hard to get back in. I am still living with the weight of that choice today, knowing that I am the one responsible for making this next chapter work.

However, I chose my family over my immediate comfort, and that experience gave me a level of resilience and maturity that I didn't have before. It taught me that being a 'man of my word' applies to my family as much as my career. I am here today because I had the courage to step back, and I now have the clarity and drive to give my absolute best to this role."

----------------------------------
41. Tell me about a time you worked Together with a team to achieve a result.  

"Since I am at the start of my professional journey, I haven't encountered many complex corporate team environments yet. However, based on my values of Integrity and Excellence, here is how I would approach it:

I believe that a successful team is built on transparency and mutual support. If I were part of a KPMG project team, I would prioritize clear communication—sharing my progress early and being honest about any blockers I face. I would look for ways to assist my colleagues, whether by peer-reviewing code or sharing resources I’ve found useful. To me, working 'Together' means ensuring that the team’s collective goal always comes before individual ego. I am eager to bring this collaborative mindset to a professional setting."

42. What does Excellence mean to you in a technical context?  
"To me, Excellence in a technical context is not about being perfect, but about the relentless pursuit of the best possible version of a solution. I am someone who constantly pushes myself to surpass my own limits. This drive for excellence is exactly why I shifted from simpler subjects to complex fields like MERN stack development, DevOps and SQA. I didn’t want the easy path; I wanted to master the technologies that challenge me the most.

In my work, excellence means writing code that isn't just 'functional,' but is clean, scalable, and thoroughly tested. It means staying up until 3:00 AM to solve a bug or perfect a feature because I believe that the quality of my work is a direct reflection of my character. For me, excellence is a habit of improvement."

43. Tell me about a situation where you worked “For Better” — created a positive impact. 

"I believe that the greatest impact technology can have is in providing free education. My 'For Better' initiative is a platform  called  Learn with mentors, I’ve designed to provide high-end IT skills to students who have the talent but lack the financial means or infrastructure.

I’ve moved this project from a vision to a completed UI design and roadmap phase. The platform isn't just a video library; it’s a gamified ecosystem with leaderboards, mentorship, and a rigorous weekly assessment model where students must pass 1-hour live interviews to progress. I’ve already connected with like-minded mentors willing to offer their expertise for free. My goal is to remove the 'wealth barrier' from tech education, ensuring that any student, regardless of their background, has a clear path to a career. This project is my commitment to using my skills for a lasting social impact."

44. Which KPMG value resonates with you the most and why?  
"The value that resonates with me most is Courage. To me, courage isn't just about taking professional risks; it’s about making difficult choices when the stakes are high.

I demonstrated this when I made the tough decision to take a career break for my family, knowing I would have to work twice as hard to return. It also took courage to shift my focus toward complex subjects like the MERN stack and to envision a startup that challenges the current expensive education model. I believe that having the courage to do what is rightfor my family, my growth, and my community—is what drives my commitment to Excellence every day."

----------------------------------
45. Tell me about your greatest professional or academic accomplishment.  

"My greatest accomplishment has been successfully teaching myself the MERN stack from scratch while maintaining a rigorous 13-hour daily study schedule.

Coming from a BCA background, I chose to tackle the most complex subjects like MERN stack and Backend Architecture. During this time, I managed to build a full-stack application and even completed 250+ leetcode questions . What makes this my proudest achievement isn't just the code; it’s the discipline and resilience I developed. I proved to myself that I could balance personal family responsibilities with high-level technical growth, and that I have the grit required to excel in any high-pressure environment."

----------------------------------

46. Walk me through your most challenging project.
"My most challenging project was my first MERN stack application, a live cake-ordering platform designed to digitize my family’s business.

Because it was my first major project, every step was a steep learning curve. I had to manage everything from database schema design in MongoDB to integrating a functional frontend. I faced constant 'trial and error' and technical obstacles, but I was driven by a real-world goal: helping my family grow their business. Despite the steep climb, I succeeded in making the application live and operational. This project taught me how to persevere through technical uncertainty and delivered my first real taste of impact-driven development."

47. Explain a time when your work helped improve a process or save time. 
and 
48. Describe a situation where your contribution had a measurable impact.  
 

"Since I am at the start of my professional journey, I haven't yet measured long-term business impact for a client. However, I have applied the value of Excellence to my own development workflow.

While building my MERN project, I realized I was losing significant time to manual repetitive testing. Every time I made a small code change, I had to manually login with specific credentials and navigate back to the same page just to verify the fix.

To solve this, I’ve been mastering the concepts of Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) testing. By automating these flows, I can eliminate that manual repetition and catch bugs instantly. I estimate this will improve my development speed by 50%, allowing me to focus on building features rather than fixing issues. I am eager to bring this disciplined, automated approach to the fast-paced project teams at KPMG."

# 🟪 7. Miscellaneous Relevant Questions

49. Something interesting about KPMG that you recently read in the news?  

"I recently read about KPMG’s massive $2 billion global investment in AI and Cloud services. What I found interesting is that it isn’t just about the technology itself, but about how KPMG is integrating 'Responsible AI' frameworks to ensure data integrity and ethics for their clients.

Additionally, I’ve been following KPMG’s 'Impact Plan,' where they’ve made significant progress in their goal to be net-zero by 2030. Seeing a firm put such a heavy focus on both technological excellence and social responsibility really confirms why I want to start my career here."

beyond that,I was impressed to see KPMG India receive the Arogya World Gold Award and recognition from Avtar for workplace equality and mental well-being in 2025.
----------------------------------


50. What motivates you to perform well at work? 

"My primary motivation is Purpose. I come from a background of significant financial hardship where I’ve seen firsthand how a lack of resources can impact a family's security. Instead of letting those challenges defeat me, I’ve used them as fuel to become a fighter.

I am driven by the responsibility to provide financial stability for my family and to serve as a role model for the youth in my hometown. Many there believe education isn't a path to success, and I want to prove them wrong by succeeding at a firm like KPMG. This 'glorious purpose' ensures that no matter how difficult a technical bug or a project deadline is, I will never quit. I’ve learned to turn exhaustion into energy and challenges into smiles, because I know exactly what I am fighting for."
